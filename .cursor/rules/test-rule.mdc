- **Write tests for all new functionality**
  - Unit tests should cover edge cases and expected behaviors
  - Integration tests should verify component interactions
  - Use Jest mocks appropriately to isolate functionality

- **Test coverage requirement**
  - New features require at least 80% test coverage
  - Critical paths must have 100% coverage

- **Test organization**
  - Place tests in `__tests__` directories adjacent to implementation
  - Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix
