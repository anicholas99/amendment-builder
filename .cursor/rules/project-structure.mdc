# Project Structure

- Maintain the established project structure.
- Organize UI components primarily within [src/components](mdc:src/components) (for shared components) and [src/features](mdc:src/features) (for feature-specific components).
- Group related components, hooks, and contexts within feature-specific directories under [src/features](mdc:src/features).
- Place shared utilities in the [src/utils](mdc:src/utils) directory.
- Define shared types in the [src/types](mdc:src/types) directory. Feature-specific types can reside within their respective feature directories.
