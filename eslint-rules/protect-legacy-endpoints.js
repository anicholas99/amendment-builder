/**
 * ðŸŽ‰ MIGRATION COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

 * ESLint Rule: protect-legacy-endpoints (DISABLED)
 * 
 * This rule is no longer needed as all legacy endpoints have been successfully migrated
 * to the standardized { success: true, data: {...} } format.
 * 
 * Final migration statistics:
 * - 101 endpoints migrated to standardized format
 * - 100% API consistency achieved
 * - Zero breaking changes during migration
 * 
 * Previously protected endpoints (now fully migrated):
 * - src/pages/api/claims/batch-update-numbers.ts âœ…
 * - src/pages/api/projects/[projectId]/claims/index.ts âœ…
 * - src/pages/api/projects/[projectId]/exclusions.ts âœ…
 *
