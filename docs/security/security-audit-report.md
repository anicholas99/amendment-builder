# Security Audit Report - Patent Drafter AI

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis Tool  
**Scope:** Next.js Patent Drafting Application Codebase

## Executive Summary

This security audit examined the Patent Drafter AI codebase for common security vulnerabilities. The application demonstrates strong security practices in most areas, with robust implementations of authentication, authorization, input validation, and file security.

## Security Findings by Category

### 1. Hard-coded Secrets, API Keys, Passwords, Tokens
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- No hardcoded secrets found in the codebase
- All sensitive configuration properly uses environment variables
- Environment variables are accessed through a centralized configuration module (`src/config/environment.ts`)
- The `.env.example` file provides documentation without exposing actual secrets
- IPD integration configuration (`src/config/ipd.ts`) properly references environment variables

### 2. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- Database queries use Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- Raw queries found in repositories use `Prisma.sql` template literals for safe parameterization:
  - `src/repositories/search/citations.repository.ts` (line 35-40)
  - `src/repositories/tenantRepository.ts` (line 85-91)
- No direct string concatenation in SQL queries detected
- All database operations go through repository layer with proper sanitization

### 3. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Vulnerabilities
**Status:** ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK  
**Severity:** Medium

**Findings:**
- Limited use of `innerHTML` found in:
  - `src/features/patent-application/utils/patentViewUtils.ts` (lines 175, 197)
  - Used for parsing HTML content in document export functionality
  - Risk is mitigated as this appears to be for document processing, not rendering user content
- React's default XSS protection is in place for most components
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage detected

**Recommendations:**
- Consider using DOMParser API instead of innerHTML for HTML parsing
- Implement content sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) for any HTML processing

### 4. Authentication/Authorization Bypasses
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- Robust authentication middleware in `src/middleware/auth.ts`
- Multi-tenant authorization properly implemented
- Service account authentication for internal services
- No bypass mechanisms or backdoors detected
- Proper session validation and user verification

### 5. CSRF Token Issues
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- CSRF protection implemented in `src/lib/security/csrf.ts`
- Uses double-submit cookie pattern
- CSRF tokens required for all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Tokens properly validated in auth middleware
- Service accounts can bypass CSRF for legitimate internal operations

### 6. Input Validation Problems
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas throughout API routes
- File upload validation in `src/lib/security/fileGuard.ts` includes:
  - File type validation using magic numbers
  - Filename sanitization
  - Size limits
  - Extension validation
  - Protection against directory traversal
- Request body validation in API handlers
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs

### 7. File Upload Security Issues
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- Excellent file security implementation in `src/server/services/storage.server-service.ts`:
  - File type validation using both MIME types and magic numbers
  - Filename sanitization to prevent directory traversal
  - Size limits enforced (5MB default)
  - Malware scanning integration (VirusTotal API)
  - Files stored in private Azure blob storage with tenant isolation
  - Secure file naming with UUIDs and timestamps
  - Metadata tracking for audit trails

### 8. Rate Limiting Implementation
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- Enhanced rate limiting in `src/lib/security/enhancedRateLimit.ts`:
  - Client fingerprinting for better identification
  - Progressive penalties for violations
  - Cost-based limiting for expensive operations
  - Support for Redis-based distributed rate limiting
  - IP-based and user-based limiting
  - Configurable skip lists for trusted sources
- Rate limiting applied via middleware to all API routes

### 9. Environment Variable Leaks
**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A

**Findings:**
- No sensitive environment variables exposed to client-side code
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefixed variables are accessible client-side
- Server-side environment access properly gated with `isServer` checks
- Centralized environment configuration prevents accidental exposure

### 10. Insecure Dependencies
**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MONITORING  
**Severity:** Low

**Findings:**
- Package.json shows security audit scripts (`test:security`, `security:scan`)
- Regular dependency updates appear to be practiced
- No obviously vulnerable packages identified

**Recommendations:**
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Set up automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
- Consider using tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot

## Additional Security Features Identified

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- CSP implementation found with configurable modes
- Migration guide available in `docs/security/csp-migration-guide.md`

### Security Logging
- Comprehensive security logging in `src/lib/monitoring/security-logger.ts`
- Audit logging for compliance tracking

### Soft Delete Implementation
- Data privacy features with soft deletes
- Proper data retention and deletion capabilities

### Multi-Tenant Security
- Tenant isolation properly implemented
- Data access scoped to authenticated tenant
- Cross-tenant access prevention

## Summary

The Patent Drafter AI application demonstrates a mature security posture with well-implemented security controls across all major vulnerability categories. The main areas for improvement are:

1. **Medium Priority:** Replace innerHTML usage with safer alternatives for HTML parsing
2. **Low Priority:** Implement automated dependency scanning and regular security audits

Overall security rating: **8.5/10** - Strong security implementation with minor areas for enhancement.

## Recommendations

1. Implement DOMPurify or similar library for any HTML content processing
2. Set up automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
3. Consider implementing security headers middleware for additional browser security
4. Regular penetration testing for production environment
5. Implement security training for development team on secure coding practices
