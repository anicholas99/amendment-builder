# CSP Security Update Testing Checklist

## Overview
We've implemented critical security improvements by removing `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from script CSP while keeping `unsafe-inline` for styles to maintain compatibility with dynamically generated styles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `next.config.js` (✅ Already in place)
- Removed `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src`
- Removed `'unsafe-eval'` from `script-src`
- Kept `'unsafe-inline'` for `style-src` (required for dynamically generated styles)

### 2. Fixed `middleware.ts` (✅ Completed)
- Removed CSP override that was using a basic policy
- Now respects the comprehensive CSP from `next.config.js`

### 3. Disabled CSP Report-Only Mode (✅ Previously done)
- Commented out `CSP_MODE=report-only` in `.env.local`

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Console for Errors
- [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12)
- [ ] Navigate to Console tab
- [ ] Look for any CSP violation errors
- [ ] Verify NO errors about blocked scripts
- [ ] Verify NO errors about blocked styles

### 3. Test Core Functionality

#### Authentication
- [ ] Login page loads without errors
- [ ] Can successfully log in
- [ ] Auth0 redirects work properly
- [ ] Logout functionality works

#### Main Application
- [ ] Projects list loads correctly
- [ ] Can create new project
- [ ] Can open existing project
- [ ] All modals open properly
- [ ] Forms submit without errors

#### UI Components
- [ ] UI components render with proper styles
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works
- [ ] Tooltips appear correctly
- [ ] Dropdowns and menus work
- [ ] No visual glitches or unstyled content

#### API Calls
- [ ] Data loads from backend
- [ ] Can save/update data
- [ ] File uploads work
- [ ] No blocked API requests

### 4. Verify Security Headers
1. Open Network tab in DevTools
2. Reload the page
3. Click on the main document request
4. Check Response Headers for:
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; ...
   ```
   - ✅ Verify `script-src` does NOT contain `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`
   - ✅ Verify `style-src` DOES contain `unsafe-inline`

### 5. Check for Breaking Changes

#### Common Issues to Watch For:
- [ ] Third-party scripts (analytics, monitoring) still work
- [ ] No inline event handlers breaking (onclick, onload)
- [ ] No `eval()` or `new Function()` errors
- [ ] React DevTools still work in development

### 6. Performance Check
- [ ] Page load time is normal
- [ ] No noticeable performance degradation
- [ ] Console is not flooded with warnings

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

1. **Temporary Rollback** (if needed):
   ```javascript
   // In next.config.js, temporarily add back:
   script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
   ```

2. **Investigate** the specific error
3. **Fix** the root cause (usually inline scripts that need refactoring)
4. **Re-apply** the secure CSP

## Expected Results

✅ **What Should Work:**
- All application functionality
- UI styling and theming
- React event handlers
- API calls
- File uploads

❌ **What Won't Work** (and shouldn't):
- Inline `<script>` tags
- `eval()` or `new Function()`
- String-based setTimeout/setInterval
- Inline event attributes (onclick="...")

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass:**
   - Commit the changes
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours
   - Deploy to production

2. **If issues found:**
   - Document the specific error
   - Check if it's a legitimate security issue
   - Refactor problematic code
   - Re-test

## Security Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Protection from XSS attacks** that could steal patent data
- ✅ **Prevention of code injection** via compromised dependencies  
- ✅ **Blocked dynamic code execution** vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Maintained usability** with the current UI framework

## Notes

- The style CSP with `unsafe-inline` is an acceptable trade-off for dynamically generated styles
- This configuration matches security best practices for React applications
- Similar approach used by GitHub, Stripe, and other security-conscious companies
