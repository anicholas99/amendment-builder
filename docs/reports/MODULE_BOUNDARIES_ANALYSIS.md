# Module Boundaries and Separation of Concerns Analysis

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Codebase:** Patent Drafter AI

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the module boundaries and separation of concerns in the Patent Drafter AI codebase. The analysis reveals several architectural issues that impact maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Key Findings

### 1. Cross-Feature Dependencies (37 violations)

The codebase has significant coupling between features, particularly:

- **Search ↔ Claim Refinement**: The search feature imports claim synchronization components
- **Projects → Multiple Features**: Project components import from technology-details, search, and patent-application features
- **Citation Extraction ↔ Search**: Bidirectional dependencies between these features

**Impact:** High coupling makes features difficult to develop, test, and deploy independently.

### 2. Business Logic in Presentation Layer (2 violations)

Direct API calls found in:
- `features/projects/components/ProjectSidebar.tsx` (lines 129, 381)

**Impact:** Violates separation of concerns, making components harder to test and reuse.

### 3. Data Access Outside Repositories (113 violations)

Direct Prisma imports found throughout:
- Type definitions (types/*.ts)
- Feature components  
- Services
- Utilities

**Impact:** Database implementation details leak throughout the codebase, making it difficult to change data access patterns or database technology.

### 4. Circular Dependencies (6 detected)

Critical circular dependencies in:
- Configuration modules (env ↔ environment ↔ logger)
- Type definitions (domain/searchHistory ↔ searchTypes)
- Context providers

**Impact:** Circular dependencies can cause initialization issues and make modules impossible to test in isolation.

### 5. Encapsulation Violations (41 violations)

- Private field access (prefixed with `_`) detected outside defining modules
- Internal implementation details exposed through exports

**Impact:** Poor encapsulation leads to brittle code and unexpected breaking changes.

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Architecture Issues

1. **Feature Coupling**: Features are not truly independent modules. They share types, utilities, and components directly.

2. **Layering Violations**: 
   - Presentation layer contains business logic
   - Data access spread throughout codebase
   - No clear service layer

3. **Missing Abstractions**:
   - No clear interfaces between features
   - Direct imports instead of dependency injection
   - Tight coupling to Prisma ORM

### Repository Pattern Implementation

The repository pattern is well-documented but not consistently enforced:

**Good:**
- Clear repository structure for data access
- Documented patterns and best practices
- Type-safe interfaces

**Issues:**
- Direct Prisma usage outside repositories (113 violations)
- Repository pattern not enforced by tooling
- Some complex business logic in repositories

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Extract Shared Dependencies**
   ```typescript
   // Instead of: features/search importing from features/claim-refinement
   // Create: shared/claim-sync or services/claim-sync
   ```

2. **Enforce Repository Pattern**
   - Add ESLint rule to prevent Prisma imports outside repositories
   - Move all data access to repository layer
   - Create repository interfaces for testing

3. **Fix Circular Dependencies**
   - Break config cycles by creating a config facade
   - Separate type definitions from implementations
   - Use lazy loading for circular context dependencies

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Feature Independence**
   - Create feature-specific APIs/contracts
   - Use event-based communication between features
   - Extract shared types to common modules

2. **Service Layer**
   - Create service layer for business logic
   - Move API calls from components to services
   - Implement proper error handling in services

3. **Type Organization**
   ```
   types/
   ├── domain/        # Pure domain types (no Prisma)
   ├── api/           # API request/response types
   ├── database/      # Database-specific types
   └── shared/        # Shared interfaces
   ```

### Long-term Architecture

1. **Module Federation**
   - Each feature as independent module
   - Clear public APIs for each module
   - Dependency injection for cross-module communication

2. **Clean Architecture Layers**
   ```
   Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure
   (Components)   (Services)    (Logic)   (Repositories)
   ```

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Use events for cross-feature communication
   - Implement event bus for loose coupling
   - Enable feature plug-and-play

## Metrics Summary

| Metric | Count | Severity |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Cross-feature dependencies | 37 | High |
| Business logic in UI | 2 | Medium |
| Data access violations | 113 | High |
| Circular dependencies | 6 | High |
| Encapsulation violations | 41 | Low |
| **Total Violations** | **193** | - |

## Monitoring Progress

Track improvements using:
- Module boundary analysis script (weekly)
- Code review checklist
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Dependency graph visualization

## Conclusion

While the codebase has good patterns in place (repository pattern, TypeScript, middleware composition), enforcement and consistency need improvement. The main issues stem from organic growth without strict architectural boundaries. Implementing the recommended changes will significantly improve maintainability, testability, and team productivity.
